# Data Structures & Algorithms
Just practicing the above. Everything is organized into a few areas:

## Problems
Solutions to problems that you'd find on sites like LeetCode and HackerRank. These are organized into namespaces according to their state: [Done](https://github.com/brswanson/DSA/tree/master/DSA/Problems/Done), [InProgress](https://github.com/brswanson/DSA/tree/master/DSA/Problems/InProgress), and [ToDo](https://github.com/brswanson/DSA/tree/master/DSA/Problems/ToDo)

## Sorting
Implementations of common [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/brswanson/DSA/tree/master/DSA/Sorting) such as MergeSort, Quicksort, etc.

## Structures
Implementations of common [data structures](https://github.com/brswanson/DSA/tree/master/DSA/Structures) such as HashTables and BSTs.
